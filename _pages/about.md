I am a senior at the University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I currently work as a research assistant within the ECE Department, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liyue Shen](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/). Previously, I worked at the [InfiniAI Lab](https://www.infini-ai-lab.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University with Prof. Beidi Chen and many wonderful collaborators. I also briefly worked with [Prof. Jingwen Hu](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/people/hu-jingwen/) at the [UMTRI](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/).
