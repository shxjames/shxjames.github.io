Despite the highly complex loss landscapes that often occur in neural network training, there have been interesting phenomena and patterns shown empirically. **Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC)** is one of those phenomena—the observation that different solutions reached by Stochastic Gradient Descent can be connected with a linear path.

In this work, I study whether LMC occurs in Transformers. I provide empirical evidence across decoder-only transformers with varying sizes and model configurations, following GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020).
